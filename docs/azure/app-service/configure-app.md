# Configure App Service App

- App settings are variables passed as environment variables to the app code.
- App settings can be resolved from Key Vault using [[key-vault]] references

## Connection strings

- For ASP .NET and ASP .NET Core developers, setting connection strings in App Service are like setting them in <connectionStrings> in Web.config, but the values you set in App Service override the ones in Web.config
- For other language stacks, it's **better to use app settings** instead, because connection strings require special formatting in the variable keys in order to access the values.
  > There is one case where you may want to use connection strings instead of app settings for non-.NET languages: certain Azure database types are backed up along with the app only if you configure a connection string for the database in your App Service app. For more information, see What gets backed up. If you don't need this automated backup, then use app settings.

## General settings

- Debugging: Enable remote debugging for ASP .NET, ASP .NET Core, or Node.js apps. This option turns off automatically after 48 hours.
- Bitness: 32-bit or 64-bit.
- WebSocket protocol: For ASP.NET SignalR or socket.io, for example.
- Always On: Keeps the app loaded even when there's no traffic. It's required for continuous WebJobs or for WebJobs that are triggered using a CRON expression
